Rest APIs commonly use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
HTTP methods to modify data. I understood CRUD by doing Practical 02
lab in class. I used Postman to perform the HTTP Requests.  


Q&A:
a. Post is used in CRUD to Create, it literally means to POST.
Put is used in CRUD for Updating the Posted resource.

b. 404.
